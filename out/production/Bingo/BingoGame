A Bingo board contains 25 spaces with 1 free space
The spaces have a unique id which is an int from 1 to 75
The player/ client is assigned 24 random spaces that are all unmarked
There are at least 2 players
Server distributes the spaces, saves the spaces into cards and displays them randomly 1 by 1
if the player has the spaces specified by the card, mark that space.

Bingo is achieved:
horizontally: 5 cards of the same row number
vertically:  5 cards of the same column letter
diagonally: [column, row]: {[0, 0] [1, 1] [2, 2] [3,3] [4,4]} or
                           {[0, 4] [1, 3] [2, 2] [3, 1] [4,0]}
Client server protocol:
Game begins when client asks for board from server
server generates board for player and saves the player into a list, saves each board spaces as a card.
When all the players are registered, server prints out individual cards.

Game ends when any user declares "Bingo"
Dealer is in charge of assuring that the player does indeed have bingo.
