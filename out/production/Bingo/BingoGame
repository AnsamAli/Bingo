A Bingo board contains 25 spaces with 1 free space
The spaces have a unique id which is an int from 1 to 75
The player/ client is assigned 24 random spaces that are all unmarked
There are at least 2 players
BingoServer distributes the spaces, saves the spaces into cards and displays them randomly 1 by 1
if the player has the spaces specified by the card, mark that space.

Bingo is achieved:
horizontally: 5 cards of the same row number
vertically:  5 cards of the same column letter
diagonally: [column, row]: {[0, 0] [1, 1] [2, 2] [3,3] [4,4]} or
                           {[0, 4] [1, 3] [2, 2] [3, 1] [4,0]}

The numbers in the B column are between 1 and 15, in the I column between 16 and 30, in the N column
(containing four numbers and the free space) between 31 and 45, in the G column between 46 and 60, and
in the O column between 61 and 75.

Calls: 
Random generator. A call is list of strings which has the column name and id number of the space. All possible cards are in this list 
B1, B2, B3 … B15 
I16, I17, I18…I30 and so on. 
Random generator looks at the indices and picks a random one. 

There is no limit to the amount of players and the same spaces can appear on multiple boards but not on the same board. 


Client server protocol:
Game begins when client asks for board from server
server generates board for player and saves the player into a list, saves each board spaces as a card.
When all the players are registered, server prints out individual cards.

Game ends when any user declares "Bingo"
Dealer is in charge of assuring that the player does indeed have bingo.
